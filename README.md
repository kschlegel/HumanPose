# HumanPose
Toolbox for stuff human pose related

This is very much work in progress, more functionality will be included here with time.

Currently contains:
- Visualisation for 2D and 3D skeletons:
  Classes Skeleton2D and Skeleton3D in the visualise package handle drawing 2D skeletons onto images and plotting 3D skeletons using matplotlib. SkeletonND simply combines the two classes into one which can seamlessly handle both if needed.

Code should generally have a reasonable amount of in-code documentation. More documentation will be added if/when the project matures sufficiently past a model for personal convenience.
